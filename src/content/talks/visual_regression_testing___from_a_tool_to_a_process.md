In this talk I will discuss how I converted PhantomCSS, a tool for visual regression testing, and integrated it into our workflow. I will also cover the challenges we faced which ranged from integrating the tests into our CI, test execution taking too long, ability to browse the test results and notifying developers about failed regressions.

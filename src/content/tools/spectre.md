Spectre is a web application to diff screenshots. It's heavily influence by [VisualReview](https://github.com/xebia/VisualReview), [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) and [Wraith](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith). Read more about how we use it at Friday in our blog post: [How we do visual regression testing](https://medium.com/friday-people/how-we-do-visual-regression-testing-af63fa8b8eb1).
